# which-chromebook
I'm learning JavaScript, and trying to rebuild www.whichchromebookshouldibuy.com using HTML/CSS/JS instead of WP
I realize that the method I use is likely not the best method. I don't need you to tell me that. If there are minor things I can do to improve please feel free to commit suggestions, but I don't want to hear things like "you should use JQuery instead".
I will leave notes inside the code describing what I'm currently trying to do. Please feel free to commit changes that will do what I'm trying to do.
